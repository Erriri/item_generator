An item generator for DND 5e magic items (but could probably work for any ttrpg with a similar setting).

Doesn't actually generate a full and working item, instead just makes a bunch of rolls on rolling tables that should be a good enough inspiration for a real magic item. 

After all, it is easier to "make a new magic item that is a light crossbow made from dragon remains, has an ancient and heroic past, and relies on the acid element to do extra damage" than "make a new magic item".

Obviously you can't make all of the rolls work out at once, so some details will need to be ignored or changed. But this should be enough to give you an idea. Also I have buttons to reroll things.


The rolling tables were made by made or taken out from the 2014 DMG. I go in depth into them in a private google doc, but realistically this thingie is just for me and my friend, so whatever, you don't get the doc >:3
